      <description>In this project, I implemented approaches that perform near-optimal combination of MOS transistors onto Integrated circuits, a process called Very Large Scale Inegration (VLSI). The process of VLSI was examined by using approaches of the known combinatorial optimization problem called Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). TSP is described as follows:   Given a set of cities and the distance between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once, and returns to the starting city?</description>
